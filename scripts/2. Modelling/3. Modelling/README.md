### [`a. training.ipynb`](a.%20training.ipynb)
Create, train, and evaluate the model

### [`b. find_cdr.ipynb`](b.%20find_cdr.ipynb)
Test the model and check the model result by visualizing the predicted mask. Also, find the CDR value from predicted mask

### [`c. evaluate_segmentation.ipynb`](c.%20evaluate_segmentation.ipynb)
Evaluate the model performance base on the CDR value created from the predicted mask image. Also get the accuracy from the classification of glaucoma or non-glaucoma
