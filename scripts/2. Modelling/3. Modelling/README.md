# Scripts Explanation
In order to replicate this project, the scripts on this folder should be run according to the alphabet order of it's name.

### [`a. training.ipynb`](a.%20training.ipynb)
Create, train, and evaluate the model

### [`b. visualize_result.ipynb`](b.%20visualize_result.ipynb)
Test the model and check the model result by visualizing the predicted mask. Also, find the CDR value from predicted mask

### [`c. evaluate_segmentation.ipynb`](c.%20evaluate_segmentation.ipynb)
Evaluate the model performance base on the CDR value created from the predicted mask image. Also get the accuracy from the classification of glaucoma or non-glaucoma

### [`d. train_log.ipynb`](d.%20train_log.ipynb)
Get the train log data from wandb
